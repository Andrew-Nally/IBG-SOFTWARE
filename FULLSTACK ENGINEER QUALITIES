In web development there are three main categories that a developer can fall into:

-front end : the stuff the user can see and interact with when using the website or app(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
-back-end: the stuff the user cant see and doesn't directly interact with such as databases and infrastructure(PHP, RUBY, PYTHON). 
-FULL STACK: works with both front end and back end development of a website or application. Can apply to a web stack mobile stack or specializes in a certain type of software programs for specific devices. They are familiar with building user-facing websites with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript and one or more of back end languages specializing in one or more. To complete their full stack status, many developers will learn project management, visual design, web design, or user experience skills.

Many jobs these days are you looking for the developer that knows how to work on all parts of the site to build a better product using the best tools for the design. They may not write the entire code themselves but they have the ability to jump in where needed at any time. The full stack developer satisfies the need for both the front end developer and the back end developer requirements.

To become a full stack developer, a person needs to have an in depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with additional knowledge of a third party library such as JQuery, ReactJS, or Angular. The also need to know programming languages and libraries like Ruby, PHP, Python and have experience with databases and version control. Knowledge of security concerns and best practices is ideal, along with design experience with UX best practices

The difference between a full stack developer and a full stack engineer is that an engineer is more of a senior level title. They are a developer with some years under the belt and some additional skill set/ experiences being project management dealing with computer networks and systems. Full stack developer jobs are more for people starting off in the tech business where as engineer jobs are the kind that developers can look forward to after some time spent in the industry.
